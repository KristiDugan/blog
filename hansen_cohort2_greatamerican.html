              <p>As students, our task seemed simple enough - to create an MVP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">(minimum viable product)</a> 
                as a team.  A minimum viable product sits somewhere between a prototype and an actual functioning app or website; it is functional 
                enough to demonstrate potential usage, but not developed enough to be using too much cost associated 
                with many development hours or dependencies.</p>
              
              <p>This seems straightforward, but something that we struggled with as students and collaborators.  How can we show a client a product that works enough to 
                demonstrate functionality, but isn’t over our heads in terms of coding skill required (very new front-end students)?
                What is a level of functionality, fake or not, that will let us flex some coding skills but also be able 
                to be completed in a very short sprint timeline?</p>

                <p>There were additional roadblocks ahead.  Perhaps some would consider our team lucky to only 
                  span one continent of timezones.  Members of our group live all over the country, 
                  and as primary caregivers, we had to navigate childcare schedules as well. </p>

              <p>Our first step was to establish when we would all be able to communicate. There was one hour at night
                 (Eastern Time) when we decided to host our nightly standup meetings that worked for all involved and 
                 included minimal child disruptions.  We knew we had to rely heavily on web-based communication, and 
                 we selected <a href="https://clickup.com/">ClickUp</a> a as a project management app. For everyday communication 
                 we used <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>. Finally, for video messaging we used <a href="https://whereby.com/">Whereby</a>, which has a pretty nice screen share feature.</p>
                <img src="img/kh2.jpg" class="img-fluid">
              
              <p>After initial client meetings, we took to the whiteboard <a href="https://miro.com/">(Miro)</a> and graphed our client needs and audience 
                using an empathy map and a target audience grid.  We used a human-centered design process, so we developed 
                a survey using <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/">Google Forms</a> and distributed it via social media such as Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, 
                and Instagram.</p>

              <p>We received our results and met again to do a virtual whiteboard pre-ideation discussion, 
                aka brainstorming session.  Once we had a few ideas in place, we analyzed them using a clever 
                <a href="https://www.mindtheproduct.com/enter-matrix-lean-prioritisation/">value and effort grid</a> to establish if the projects would hit both our targets of providing value 
                to the client and also being realistic in terms of the effort that we were able to exert.</p>

              <p>We had a very straightforward idea - imagine a blog with a few very straightforward blog-like 
                functions.  We mocked-up this two page wireframe in <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, which also has amazing team features, 
                although the UI has a bit of a learning curve for those not familiar with design  software. </p>

              <p>Once framed, we realized that our project needed to take in data, and also display it.  
                As beginner front-end developers, we weren’t entirely comfortable with the idea of a database.  
                <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch.com</a> has an awesome Node.js and SQLite starter file, and we were able to create a persistent 
                database on a single page.</p>
              <img src="img/kimg3.jpg" class="img-fluid">
              <p class="sub-title-image">Glitch.com is an amazingly cool website with a really awesome community.  Start building with 
                Node.js and SQLite already set up!  Plus, really rad design for 90s kids like me.</p>
              
              <p>We realized, however that our javascript skills were not as mature as what was needed to develop a multi-page form system that this project required.  A few other javascript hiccups and the fact that there are no forking options on Glitch made dividing the project load a little challenging.  We were led to the decision to abandon this project and take a different approach.  We went full-stack.</p>

              <p>As newly hatched front-end developers we had never been advised to “never go full-stack”, and after a weekend debacle of 
                wasted hours that could not have been choreographed more comically then Ben Stiller himself, we realized that a Ruby 
                project with a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostreSQL</a> database was not for us.  Only two members of our team could even get <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a> to work on their machines, and as a democratic peoples, this was not a workable solution, even if a database would have just solved all of our problems.
                </p>
              <p>Enter the happy medium solution - a completely fake front-end only solution using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  Under the advice of a mentor, we decided to start very simply. Time permitting we would then be able to add more back-end features, but we would always have an existent frame to demo and show our client.  For MVP purposes, fake is ok, as long as it portrays an idea appropriately.</p>

              <p>We were relieved with this solution until one group member (surely not the author of this post!) basically broke the project's 
              GitHub repository twice in 24 hours.  But that is a story for the sequel.</p>
              <p>While we were developing this front end, we began a draft of our demo video script, including 
                voice-over scripts and shot descriptions.  We also began an outline for a final presentation to 
                other students and the client. We plan to use <a href="https://www.loom.com/">Loom</a> to record our demo video.</p>
            
                <p>At this point, we are far from the finish line, which is 8 days away. Many more things will break, but it has taken these breaks to remind us that sometimes simple is best.  Starting simple and building on complexity will be the moral that I’m taking away from this experience and hope to apply it to other future builds.</p>
