                <p> Nearly every self-taught beginning web developer has been here. After going through a couple HTML and
                    CSS tutorials, the next step is to create your own site, right? The tutorials have demystified the
                    coding process and reveal that websites aren’t so complicated: some DIV tags, a handful of images, and
                    a style sheet and suddenly, you’ve created (with their instructions) a beautiful, functional site.
                    Go forth young grasshopper, with the newfound power to build web things!
                    <br /><br />
                    Not so fast.
                    
                    While it’s true that many website don’t require complicated or advanced HTML and CSS to work well and
                    look good, there’s much more to web development than just the code. In my experience, there are four
                    major questions to answer before even creating your index.html.
                    <br /><br />
                    Full disclosure here: I too, am in the early stages of a career transition into
                    coding. I also have years of experience in layout, editing, and general principles of design from a
                    communications perspective. Yet rarely are design decisions mentioned within the context of a coding
                    lesso. Because a web browser is a visual medium, development and design are closely intertwined. I realize
                    that a lot of devs don't want to consider design priciples, but when a web developer is making coding
                    decisions,
                    they’re affecting the functionality of the site for a user - inherently impacting the design.
                    <br /><br />
                    So when finally leaving tutorial-land and tackling that first website - where’s a newbie to start, to make
                    something
                    that works well and looks good? A little planning will go a
                    long way in stretching your new skills to produce a website that is both visually pleasing and
                    functionally useful.
                    <br /><br />
                    So these are the four key questions to answer before writing a single line of code:</p>
                
                <p><br />
                  <strong>1. Establish your purpose - What’s the point?</strong>
                  The first thing to determine is this: why are you making this site? Is it for a product, an idea,
                  to inform, to entertain? What do you want this site to do or offer to its intended audience? Without
                  determining your purpose, it’s nearly impossible to figure out how the site should be constructed for a
                  user.
                  <br /><br />
                  Use the following sentence starter to get you going:
                  <br />
                  <strong>The purpose of this website is to (intended action) for (intended user) by
                    (the methods to fulfill the action).</strong>
                  <br /><br />
                  Don’t get too caught up on this step either. The purpose doesn’t have to be earth-shatteringly important.
                  I think my first website circa 2002 was an entertaining homage to the perky pop punk music I blasted 20
                  hours a day (Sum 41, anyone?). Just jot down a sentence or two of what you want your finished product to do
                  or communicate. By defining this goal, you can actively code an experience for an audience that will meet
                  its intended purpose.</p>
  
                <p><strong>2. Determine function - How do you want it to work?</strong>
                  Underneath the purpose sentence(s) you wrote to answer number 1, list the pages and functions
                  that will be necessary to bring this purpose to life. How many pages does the site need to have,
                  and what content will each page hold? Will some simple paragraphs and text links suffice, or will
                  forms and buttons need to be incorporated for additional functionality?
                  <br /><br />
                  Once this list is drafted, assign your list items into either “header” navigation and “footer” navigation,
                  with the “header” items being the main features of your site. These two designations will serve as
                  guideposts for the rest of your layout, since the header anchors the top of a website and the footer,
                  the bottom.</p>

                  <p><strong>3. Sketch an outline - How should it be laid out?</strong>
                    A layout, or wireframe, is a blueprint of your site and helps to create the visual structure.
                    You’ll need to assign a spot to each of the functions and pages you’ve already detailed above.
                    It can be easier to construct your wireframe when looking at other sites for inspiration, and
                    following a similar framework. Don’t worry too much at this point about the specific images or colors -
                    the best method for wireframing is actually to stick to greyscaled elements. This will help you
                    determine the layout and content to best fit your site’s functionality, making it easy for a user to
                    navigate.
                    <br /><br />
                    Actually constructing the wireframe can be done in a variety of ways. The most basic and easiest
                    route is to go low-tech, and sketch out the general layout of your site pages on a piece of paper.
                    But this method can be hard to edit and refer back to, so there are a lot of programs available that
                    will help you build a wireframe with more precision. My personal favorite is <a href="https://www.figma.com/">
                      Figma</a>, a free browser-based interface design application.
                  </p>

                  <p><strong>4. Detail the “vibe,” or style - What impression should it create?</strong>
                    There are entire fields of study and a variety of industries dedicated to the design of visual
                    communications, but a couple of basic decisions will serve newbie coders well. The easiest way to design
                    a page is to keep the visuals consistent and simple. Come up with a theme of 2-3 colors and fonts, and
                    use only those fonts and colors. Consistent visuals paired with a predetermined layout means your site
                    will look polished and ready for its audience.
                    <br /><br />
                    I usually ask myself to jot down a few word that should come to mind when a user views the website -
                    light, airy and quirky? Playful, kid-friendly? Serious, professional, and futuristic? Then choose the
                    colors and font that associate with the descriptions. If you’re stuck, a quick Google search for
                    something like “web color schemes” will turn up a ton of articles and resources with suggestions for
                    complementary color combinations (hex codes included!).
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Hopefully, by using these four questions to guide the planning of your first website,
                    the task is a lot less daunting. You don't have to be a designer to create something useful and good looking!
                    Most importantly, don't let these answers paralyze you -- jot something down, and just get started!
