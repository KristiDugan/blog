                    Learning to code can be extremely overwhelming. You are
                    likely learning basic internet and computer fundamentals,
                    grappling over JavaScript, and learning how to efficiently
                    use your text editor. Then there is Git….. where, let’s face
                    it, you are pushed into the deep end of adding, committing,
                    pushing and never-ending merge conflicts with an expectation
                    to swim. Now, I am no lifeguard, but let me at least teach
                    you some stroke techniques so you can tread water.

                  <p>
                    <i><b>Git</b></i> is a popular
                    <i>distributed version control system</i>. It allows you to
                    work in a team-based environment with other developers by
                    enabling a non-linear development process.
                  </p>
                  <p><b>I STILL DON'T GET IT. HALLLLLP!</b></p>
                  <p>
                    Think of it as the opposite of an assembly line - you don’t
                    have to depend on the person in front of you to finish their
                    portion before you can work on yours. Git is a tool that
                    allows developers to be able to make changes simultaneously
                    and then combine all of their work in Master, at the end.
                  </p>

                          >Git’s Core Functionality is to save checkpoints (or
                          commits) you have made within the code base, and share
                          them with other people.</u
                        ></b
                      ></font
                    >
                    Everything about git revolves around this notion.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Creating checkpoints allows a developer the ability to refer
                    back to it whenever they want. This is exceptionally handy
                    when you deploy a new product that ends up creating a bug
                    that critically affects users. Git allows you the ability to
                    roll back the deployment to the previous checkpoint and the
                    developers get a chance to squash the bug and attempt
                    deployment again.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <i><b>Github,</b></i> on the other hand, is like a file
                    cabinet - it’s literally a hub that stores your repository
                    and all the code that is sent (or pushed) to it from
                    computers running the Git tool.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Now that you understand what Git <b><i>is</i></b> and it’s
                    core functionality, let’s talk about how it
                    <b><i>works</i></b
                    >. Below is a simplified guide on the very basic flow of Git
                    commands that you will use frequently in the command-line
                    interface (CLI). These commands show you how to create your
                    own checkpoints and implement your changes to your Master
                    (or desired) branch.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    To put these commands into perspective, let’s look at them
                    as stages of commitment in a relationship:

                    changes to (in this blog I will be referring to it as
                    Master, but it could be any branch). You are then going to
                    pull in any changes that have been made recently from your
                    other teammates in Master to your local machine.

                    the specified branch (in our case Master). ‘Git push’ takes
                    a snapshot of the changes you made and gives it to Master.
                    <br />Once you have pushed, you can go to github and create
                    a pull request by doing the following:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Go to the page for the repository and click on the pull
                      requests tab
                    </li>
                    <li>Click the “New Pull Request” Button</li>
                    <li>
                      Select the branch you want to submit, and write a summary
                      of what your change explaining what it is intended to do
                      and how it is implemented
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    The pull request just means that you are asking for
                    permission for your contributions/revisions to be added to
                    the project’s main repository (this is part of Github NOT
                    Git).
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    After a successful push + approval of pull request, your new
                    code will go into the Master the branc. Your teammates will
                    then be able to view your changes by using ‘git pull’ in the
                    Master branch.
                  </p>

                    Understanding how Git works and what it can do for you is
                    extremely important and will save you so much time in the
                    future. It is vital in recovering from merge conflicts,
                    which commonly happens and brings developers a lot of grief.

                    Welp, there you have it! You are now a git pro!! ...just
                    kidding! There is so much to learn about git and there are
                    developers out there who have been in the field for 10+
                    years who still have to research what to do for specific
                    things git-related. So, know that you’re not alone and once
                    you interact with git on your own, it begin to click.
                    Meanwhile, tread that water! You got this!!!

                      I love to find innovative solutions to social problems.
                      Working in Social Work, I’ve seen how tech can help reach
                      vulnerable populations; helping people make more informed
                      decisions, creating ways for people to connect, and giving
                      people access to the tools they need to have agency in
                      their own lives. The myriad of possibilities piqued my
                      interest and so I decided to pursue an education at
                      Fullstack Academy to become a software engineer to put my
                      innovative ideas at play.
                      <p>
                        I am a mother of two VERY strong-willed children, and
                        two rambunctious dogs. When I am not coding, I'm off
                        hiking in the Pacific Northwest, traveling abroad, or
                        have my nose in a captivating book. I have a strong
                        passion for music and a deep love for black and white
                        film photography. I am excited to continue to couple my
                        expertise in Social Work with my passion as a full-stack
                        developer to have a positive and lasting impact on the
                        lives of many.
