          Github is a Git repository hosting service. Git is a command line tool. Github provides access 
          control, collaboration features and time management tools. Digital directories or storage space 
          called Repositories can be created. Either individually or used as a team to build a project. 
          People can create private or public repositories. The Repoâ€™s as they are also referred to can be 
          forked. Which makes a copy of a repo.  They can be cloned, which takes that copy locally to your 
          computer. You can access it in the Git bash Terminal. Any changes done to your repo or a forked 
          repo can be pushed to be merged with the master branch. And everyone will have the most recent 
          updates once they do a Git pull. These last steps of git push and git pull are all done in Git. 
          We will leave that for another blog. For now we will review how to create a repo, fork and clone 
          it to your local computer.

          private or public. And if you would like to add a ReadMe. Which is an added text box at the bottom 
          of your files where you can explain what the project is and how or what you used to build the code. 
          Then click on Create repository button.
