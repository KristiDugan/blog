            A month into my web development class and I lay awake in bed at night, my new developer mind brimming with possibilities of all the creations I could build and share with the world. Coding is pretty darn magical. Boiled way down: you push some buttons in the correct order and out comes a brand new thing- that anyone in the world can see! Mind-blowing, right? *starts making a to-do list of domain names to buy and features to build* <br /><br />
            At this point, my super responsible product brain saunters into the picture and says, “Just because you CAN build it, doesn’t mean you should.” Whoa! What? Who let that guy in here? What a buzzkill. Unfortunately, he’s right. Here’s why.

        <h2>Product management’s importance in the development process</h2><br />
        <p class="article-para">
          <br />
          As a developer, it is our job to build the thing right, but are we sure we are building the right thing? This is where product management comes into play. The art of <a href="https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2011/10/what-exactly-is-a-product-manager/" style="color: #5070BB !important; border-bottom:1px solid black;">product management</a> is loosely defined as <b>solving a problem for the customer while bringing value to the business.</b> In this case, <b>problem</b>= make the customer’s life easier and <b>value</b>= money! Why is that important? Well, think of it this way: if a thing gets built because a company thinks it will be amazing, but people don’t actually need it to improve their lives, no one will buy it and the company won’t make any money to make more of the thing. Sad story, right? It happens a lot. We are human and have ideas that we want to share. <br /><br />
          One of my favorite examples of this is a salt shaker that you...wait for it...can use an app to operate. Seriously, check it out. It’s called the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/3/16088526/smalt-smart-salt-shaker-app-alexa-smartphone" style="color: #5070BB !important; border-bottom:1px solid black;">Smalt</a>- it can play music through a BlueTooth speaker, has mood lighting, and will only set you back $200. Currently, their site invites you to add yourself to a waitlist if you select the pre-order button- even though it was released in 2017.  How do you avoid heading down this road? Here are a few tips to keep you on the right path.

        <h2>Building the right thing</h2><br />
          <h3 style="text-align:left;font-size:22px;">Test your assumptions</h3>
          <div style="text-align:left"
          <p class="article-para">
            
            Heading back to high school and the old scientific method now. Here’s a quick review: <br /> <br />
        
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Watch people. <b>Make some observations</b> about their behavior and find something that they have trouble with. Decide on your target customer. What question do you need to answer? What problems are they having?</li><br />
            <li>Learn everything you can and <b>research</b> about the specific problem you have chosen to try and solve. Look at quantitative data. Talk to the customers (or potential customers). Are other companies trying to solve the same problem? How are they doing it? What are the potential pitfalls if you solve the problem? What are the benefits for the company, the customers, the environment, ethics, betterment of the world?</li><br />
            <li>From your research, form an educated guess (<b>hypothesis</b>) about what you think will happen in an experiment. Come to terms with the fact that it may not go the way you think it will.</li><br />
            <li>Make a light version of your thing and run your <b>experiment</b>! We’re not talking feature-complete, <i>by any means</i>. Don’t dump your precious time and energy into something that may not be the thing that solves this problem. We’re talking wireframes and <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/paper-prototyping-the-practical-beginners-guide/" style="color: #5070BB !important; border-bottom:1px solid black;">paper prototypes</a> here. This is you testing your assumptions.</li><br />
            <li>Watch and learn. Collect all the <b>data</b>. Have a buddy observe and take notes while you run the experiment or record the session for later review if you can.</li><br />
            <li>Time to <b>analyze</b> all the data. What happened? Were you surprised? Did you learn something new?</li><br />
            <li>Use all the great insights from your analysis to inform the direction you take with your idea. This is your <b>conclusion</b>. Do you move forward with a few minor tweaks? Do you come up with a new hypothesis to test?</li><br />
            <li>Wash, rinse, repeat.</li>
          </ol>

        <h3 style="text-align:left;font-size:22px;">The customer’s problem is always right</h3>
        <p class="article-para">
          Boots on the ground will be your best ally in this process. Find your target audience and meet up with them. Offer them gift cards or pay for a coffee to hear what they have to say and watch them use your prototype/beta/MVP. Watch for ease of use and understanding of your flow - take notes on where they get stuck. Ask about their motivations for wanting to use (or not use) a product like yours. Do they already use products that are similar? What do they like/dislike about those? If you can’t get an in-person meet up that’s okay. Hop on the phone, watch them use your site with <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/" style="color: #5070BB !important; border-bottom:1px solid black;">behavioral trackers</a> or <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/" style="color: #5070BB !important; border-bottom:1px solid black;">user testing</a> tools, create surveys, or engage in forum conversations. <br /> <br />
          Notice that I didn’t say that the customer is always right- because they aren’t. <b>Listen close and focus on the actual problem they are having, not potential solutions that they are offering.</b> Solutions are funny things- one specific solution may make perfect sense to one customer, but no sense at all to another customer. Users differ by age, location, culture, income, experience level, fitness level, etc. One thing that your target users <i>should</i> have in common is the same problem to solve. It’s your job to find a solution that solves that problem for your target users, regardless of what varies them from each other.<br /> <br />
          The biggest thing to watch out for here is that you are <i>listening to</i> and <i>believing</i> your customers. It may be disappointing to hear that an idea you thought was brilliant isn’t well understood by the user. Be okay with that and move on to your next experiment if that happens to you.<br /><br />
        </p>
        
        <h3 style="text-align:left;font-size:22px;">Get ready (and excited!) to fail</h3>
        <p class="article-para">
          In my house, we have a saying, “You win some, you learn some.” It’s COMPLETELY okay if your experiments don’t confirm your hypotheses. It means you tried out an idea, didn’t spend a ton of initial effort, and learned something fast- before putting in all that time to code a thing that people won’t use/understand/find value in. That is awesome! It means you are learning a TON about your target customer and becoming the expert on them. All this rigor bodes well for you and your product. *Sooner or later, you <I>will</I> have an experiment that validates your hypothesis. You have now found your thing to build! Congrats on sticking with it! <br /> <br />
          *If for some reason, it doesn’t quite happen like that - don’t fret - go talk to more customers and get <I>crystal</I> clear on the problem you need to solve.<br /> <br />
        </p>
        <br />

         <h2>Now go build the thing right!</h2><br /><br />
         <div style="text-align:left;"
         <p class="article-para">
           If you put the time in to: <br />
         </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Test your assumptions (using the scientific method)</li>
                <li>Listen to and observe the customer’s problem (not their proposed solutions)</li>
                <li>Fail fast and learn</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="article-para">
            ...then you will have the confidence that you are building something that people will pay you money for. You are solving problems and bringing value to the business! Now get that thing in their hands and make someone’s life a bit easier. That’s the real magic.<br /><br />

           This was a crash course in the user experience aspect of product management- bringing the voice of the customer into development. These go a bit further into the weeds, but if product management interests you, here are a few great blogs to read: <br /> <br />

Curiosity, drive, and a strong passion for bringing the voice of the customer into the product development process led Jayme to cultivate a career in product management. Many years in various customer service/community manager roles fed the desire to be a larger part of delighting customers through thoughtful, user-centered product development. As an enrolled student at MomsCan: Code School, Jayme is excited about learning another facet of product creation, this time on the engineering side of things. She is learning how to think about problems in a new way and enjoys applying what she has learned to other areas of her life. When not learning to code you can find her traveling the world with her family, geocaching, or hiking in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest. She would love to connect with you on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaymehewitt/" style="color: #5070BB !important; border-bottom:1px solid black;">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
