            A month into my web development class and I lay awake in bed at night, my new developer mind brimming with possibilities of all the creations I could build and share with the world. Coding is pretty darn magical. Boiled way down: you push some buttons in the correct order and out comes a brand new thing- that anyone in the world can see! Mind-blowing, right? *starts making a to-do list of domain names to buy and features to build* <br />
            At this point, my super responsible product brain saunters into the picture and says, “Just because you CAN build it, doesn’t mean you should.” Whoa! What? Who let that guy in here? What a buzzkill. Unfortunately, he’s right. Here’s why.

          <strong>Product management’s importance in the development process</strong>
          As a developer, it is our job to build the thing right, but are we sure we are building the right thing? This is where product management comes into play. The art of <a ref=https://www.mindtheproduct.com/2011/10/what-exactly-is-a-product-manager/>product management</a> is loosely defined as <b>solving a problem for the customer while bringing value to the business.</b> In this case,<b>problem</b>= make the customer’s life easier and <b>value</b>= money! Why is that important? Well, think of it this way: if a thing gets built because a company thinks it will be amazing, but people don’t actually need it to improve their lives, no one will buy it and the company won’t make any money to make more of the thing. Sad story, right? It happens a lot. We are human and have ideas that we want to share. <br />
          One of my favorite examples of this is a salt shaker that you...wait for it...can use an app to operate. Seriously, check it out. It’s called the <a ref=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/3/16088526/smalt-smart-salt-shaker-app-alexa-smartphone>Smalt</a>- it can play music through a BlueTooth speaker, has mood lighting, and will only set you back $200. Currently, their site invites you to add yourself to a waitlist if you select the pre-order button- even though it was released in 2017.  How do you avoid heading down this road? Here are a few tips to keep you on the right path.

          <strong>Building the right thing</strong>
          <h3>Test your assumptions</h3>
          Heading back to high school and the old scientific method now. Here’s a quick review: <br /> 
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Watch people. <b>Make some observations</b> about their behavior and find something that they have trouble with. Decide on your target customer. What question do you need to answer? What problems are they having?</li>
            <li>Learn everything you can and <b>research</b> about the specific problem you have chosen to try and solve. Look at quantitative data. Talk to the customers (or potential customers). Are other companies trying to solve the same problem? How are they doing it? What are the potential pitfalls if you solve the problem? What are the benefits for the company, the customers, the environment, ethics, betterment of the world?</li>
            <li>From your research, form an educated guess (<b>hypothesis</b>) about what you think will happen in an experiment. Come to terms with the fact that it may not go the way you think it will.</li>
