          <strong>Top left bell icon-Start with the bell!</strong>
          You can adjust a lot of settings there to create a space that is most apt for productivity. You can also ‘pause’ your notifications for a customizable timeframe to maintain a distraction free environment.

          <strong>The ‘+’ next to Direct Messages-Press it!</strong>
          This will enable you to create a custom direct message with anyone in the group. Working on a team project? Set up a chat for just you to brainstorm and plan. Too shy to post a question in the main board? Direct message to get those answers.
        </p>

        <p class="article-para">
          <strong>Starring-Don’t lose the important stuff!</strong>
          The star power, as I call it, can be applied to most things on Slack. This allows you to keep things of value to you in one location. (top right corner) If you no longer need something, unstar.

          <strong>Search Bar-Find it quick!</strong>
          Looking for a Zoom meeting and can’t remember where you saw it? No need to get flustered scrolling through posts. Top right search bar to the rescue. </span>
