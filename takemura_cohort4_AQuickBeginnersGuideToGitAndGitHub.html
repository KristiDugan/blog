                                <p>Up until a few weeks ago, I had no clue what Git and GitHub were. Perhaps just like you. They have the same word 'git', so are they the same thing? I recognize that cat character from GitHub but what does the platform do?
                                    I had so many question marks back then.</p>

                                <p>Honestly speaking, I am no where near an expert in Git or GitHub yet. However, as a very recent learner I will explain in simple words the WHAT and the HOW of Git and GitHub so you won't feel so intimidated! Please note
                                    that I will not go into too much detail to keep things simple. For any additional resources you can refer to the links I have shared within this post.</p>

                                <h6><b>What is Git and GitHub?</b></h6>

                                <p>So Git and GitHub, are they the same thing? Short answer is, no! So how are they different?<br> Git is a type of version control system (VCS) that lets you track the history of your code as you and your team collaborate
                                    on projects together. It also allows each developer to work locally on their computer and later merge them together as one master code. There are actually many variations of VCS similar to Git which you can learn more
                                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">here</a>. Out of those, Git is the one you hear most often because it is one of the most used systems in the world, and also one which GitHub is built on.
                                    <br> Then what is GitHub? GitHub is a social platform that hosts Git coding projects. It hosts the largest amount of open source projects and its social features allow you to collaborate with other developers. Similar
                                    to Git, keep in mind that although you hear a lot about GitHub, they are not the only code hosting platform. You can learn more about other platforms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_source-code-hosting_facilities">here</a>.</p>

                                <h6><b>How do you use Git and GitHub?</b></h6>
                                <p>So let's say you want to try using Git and GitHub. Where and how do you start? <br>The initial step is to <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git#setting-up-git">install and set up Git on your local computer</a>                                    and <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account#next-steps">create a GitHub account</a>. To connect the two, the next step is to <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git">authenticate with GitHub from Git</a>.
                                    These links provide a very detailed step by step guide, so I will instead focus on how you can start collaborating with others using Git and GitHub.<br> Let's start with the basic terms you should start to familiarize
                                    yourself with, which I listed below. These are not by all means comprehensive, but a good place to start without overwhelming you! There are always resources such as the <a href="https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf">Git Cheat Sheet</a>                                    whenever you want to know more.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Fork</strong><br> Fork your own copy of the upstream repository to your GitHub account (This fork will become your 'origin' repository)

                                    <li><strong>Clone</strong><br>Clone the forked repository to your local computer by first copying the remote URL of either HTTPS or SSH, whichever you chose when you <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git#next-steps-authenticating-with-github-from-git">authenticated with GitHub from Git. </a>
                                        <img src="img/aiko_githubClone.png" alt="Clone button on GitHub" width="100%"> Then open the Terminal (for Mac users) or Git Bash (for Windows users) and type this command:<br>
                                        <code>$ git clone [remote URL you copied from GitHub]</code> <br>Note that the square brackets are there for guidance and is not necessary to be typed in. This will create a copy of the repository on your local
                                        desktop.
                                    </li><br>
                                    <li><strong>Create branch</strong><br>In the cloned repository on your local computer, initially you will be on the master branch. Developers typically do not make edits directly on the master but instead create their own
                                        branch and merge later with the master. Therefore you should create a new branch using this command:
                                        <br><code>$ git branch [branch name]</code><br> In order to switch from the master branchto your own branch, you will type this command:
                                        <br><code>$ git checkout [branch name]</code></li><br>
                                    <li><strong>Add, commit and push</strong><br>Once you have made your edits in the text editor (such as Atom, Sublime or Visual Studio Code), you will add, commit and push your local branch to the origin repository. The
                                        three commands you need are:<br>
                                        <code>$ git add [file name]<br>
                                        $ git commit -m "add new file" </code><br> (For commit, it is best practice to add a message for your collaborators in parenthesis that describes the edit you have made) <br><code>$ git push origin [branch name]</code><br>(This
                                        command pushes the committed edits made on your local branch to your forked 'origin' repository in GitHub) Note that this 'origin' repository is still your own forked copy so you need to request the edits to the
                                        upstream repository and get them approved by theowner. </li><br>

                                    <li><strong>Wait for approval</strong><br>If your request needs any changes, the owner will ask for the code to be revised. If it looks good, it will be approved and your code gets merged to the master branch of the upstream

                                <p>Though I've only scratched the surface, I hope this quick beginner's guide gave you a better understanding of what Git and GitHub are and how they work.
                                    <p>For further learnings, I recommend checking out the <a href="https://lab.github.com/">GitHub Learning Lab</a> as a start. When you run into an error or a problem, there's always the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>                                        community which will most likely have your answers!
                                    </p>Thank you for taking the time to read this post, and good luck on your code collaboration journey!</p>
