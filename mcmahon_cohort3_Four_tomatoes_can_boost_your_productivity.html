                    <strong>Tomatoes are in my DNA</strong>.  As a young girl, I watched my Nunu (Italian grandfather) pick tomatoes from his garden for my Nana (Italian grandmother) so she could make her homemade sauce.  Before using the Pomodoro Technique, four tomatoes would be used to make a small tomato salad, now I use them to boost my productivity.

                    <strong>The Pomodoro Technique</strong>
                    uses a timer to break down a task into 25-minute intervals of work separated by short breaks, use 5-minutes to start. The time management tool uses a kitchen timer shaped like a tomato (the Italian word is “pomodoro”).  It was developed in the late 1980s by <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique" style="color: #507BB !important; border-bottom: 1px solid black;">Francesco Cirillo</a> and has since been used by various professionals and organizations to promote productivity.</p>

                    My task was to write a technical blog post. I decided to divide my work into four intervals (Pomodoros) and prepare my workspace. Pre-pomodoro prep included: pomodoro (kitchen time), pen, paper, computer and cup of water.

                    Thank you, old kitchen timer purchased specifically for my baby shower. It is beneficial to hear the timer ticking so your brain knows that you are working for a specific timeframe. If you don’t have a kitchen time, you can download a timer on your computer or phone.

                <p class="article-para">
                    I started to brainstorm topics and ideas for my technical blog post until I heard the Pomodoro buzz. I stopped what I was doing then put a check mark after my first pomodoro. In order to be successful, eliminate all distractions. If you think of something during the working period, quickly write it down then return to the task at hand.

                    My first break consisted of letting my dog outside.  Stopping for a break is probably the hardest part about using this technique. I get on a roll and want to keep going but that continuous non-stop approach eventually catches up to you, hello mental fatigue.

                    After my short break, I repeated steps two-four for three more intervals using the plan established in step one to complete my full cycle. Breaks two and three included: putting away dishes and switching out laundry.
