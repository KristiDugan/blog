          I LOVE fonts!  I love discovering new fonts. I love playing with different fonts in a headline to see how it changes the feel of something. I love mixing them together to create a bit of word art. Fonts can completely change the look of a site. A light, airy, hand-sketched font can add whimsy, while a big, bold, heavy font adds weight and emphasis to what you have to say. I have hundreds of fonts installed on my laptop and my brain gets a little giddy thinking about which ones I’ll dust off when I start on a new project.<br /><br />
          We were recently asked to create a front-end storefront for a boutique website in our website development class. I was excited to take on the task of finding a color palette and fonts for our project. I found a few that I liked and added them to my CSS code under font-family. They looked awesome! One day, during a video meeting, my remote partner shared her screen with me to show me her latest addition to our project. I was surprised to discover that my chosen fonts weren’t showing up on my partner’s computer, just regular old Times New Roman. What?!? I was bummed. Did this mean that I was only allowed to use <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/web-safe-fonts-3467430" style="color: #5070BB !important; border-bottom:1px solid black;">web safe fonts</a>? Not quite, enter WOFF.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        
        <h2>What is WOFF?</h2>
       
        <p class="article-para">
          <br />
          WOFF is an acronym that stands for <b>W</b>eb <b>O</b>pen <b>F</b>ont <b>F</b>ormat. WOFF files are OpenType or TrueType fonts that have been compressed and given a bit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML" style="color: #5070BB !important; border-bottom:1px solid black;">XML</a> metadata. The data helps them stand out to browsers as a web font that needs to be downloaded to the page for display, not just a font that is used locally on one’s computer. The compression speeds up the transfer process between a server and a computer on a network connection.
        </p>
        <br /><br />

        <h2>Why do you need WOFF files?</h2>
        
        <p class="article-para">

          My partner didn’t have the fonts that I picked out for our project installed on her computer. When she looked at our code on the server preview, her computer picked out a basic web safe font to display our text in, because it didn’t recognize the font-family I stuck in the CSS. To put it bluntly, not everyone is as font-crazed as me, so I shouldn’t expect them to have the fonts that I love installed on their computer. If you want a better chance that most people will have the experience that you have designed for them, you need to use WOFF files for any non-web safe fonts that you choose to use.

        <h2>How do I get WOFF files?</h2> <br />

          <p class="article-para">
            Once you have picked out your TrueType or OpenType fonts you need to convert them to WOFF. There are lots of converters out there. A simple, free one that I found to use was <a href="https://cloudconvert.com/" style="color: #5070BB !important; border-bottom:1px solid black;">cloudconvert</a>.</p><br />
            <h4 style="text-align:left;font-size:22px;">Here are your steps for conversion magic:</h4>
          <div style="text-align:left"
            <br />
        
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Select your TTF or OTF file from your computer</li><br />
            <li>To select your format, click on ‘Font’ and ‘WOFF’</li><br />
            <li>Click on ‘Start Conversion’ at the bottom</li><br />
            <li>The conversion will take a few seconds then you can download your new WOFF file</li><br />
          </ol>
          </div>

          <p class="article-para">
           After you have downloaded your file you will need to add your new font to a ‘fonts’ folder in your project. Once it is cozy in its new home you can begin to use it.</p><br />

        <br />
         
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Define your font-family in your CSS code. In the example below, you can see the path for my font, ‘bellaboo’.</li><br />

            <li>Now you can use your font! Here’s an example of some CSS for the body of my site:</li><br />
