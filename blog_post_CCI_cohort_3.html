                    <strong>Congratulations on starting your coding journey! </strong>
                    You’re probably feeling excited and overwhelmed by all the new
                    lingo that is rolling off of everyone’s tongues. Here are a few tips to help you ease into your new
                    coding life.
                </p>

                    <strong>You've set up a GitHub, created your first repository, and even added some files. Now what?
                    </strong> Let's use the terminal to clone your repository onto your computer. A terminal is
                    text-based interface where you can interact with your files. When working in the
                    terminal, you are always in a directory (or folder) somewhere on your computer. Cloning your
                    repository using the terminal serves several purposes. First, it establishes a connection between
                    your computer and your GitHub repository, and the terminal will know where to send your coding
                    projects. Next, it
                    creates the directory on your local
                    computer. It also initializes the repository so the terminal tracks changes to your files.
                </p>

                <p class="article-para">
                    <strong>Copy the web URL of your repository. </strong>Click the green Clone or download button
                    in your GitHub repository (right side of the screen). The web URL of your repository will appear
                    in a drop down below the button. Click the button next to it (clipboard with an arrow) to copy
                    it.

                    <br><strong>Clone your repository to your computer. </strong>Launch your terminal. This could be in
                    VSCode or another tool. At the command prompt, type <strong>git clone </strong>and paste the url
                    that you just copied, and hit enter. This will create a copy of your repository onto your computer.

                    (this is like saving your work to the cloud). You need to prepare your files to be pushed. First,
                    save your work. With your cursor anywhere in your code, press CTRL+S. This saves your work to your
                    local (on your computer) repository.

                    This is called staging the file. You do this with a git add command: git add filename (Intermediate
                    tip: if you type the first letter of the filename and hit tab, the terminal will cycle through all
                    your files so you don’t have to type the whole filename).
