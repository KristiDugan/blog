                <p>Relax, this is not a grammar lesson, but really you <em>should</em> learn about modals. In web 
                  development, the term modal refers to a window that pops up at a time we specify or when a certain 
                  event happens on the web page. Sometimes animations accompany the image to transition it onto the 
                  page rather than having it appear abruptly. The window is usually a call-to-action (CTA) and is 
                  often shown with a darkened backdrop in order to draw attention to the modal. Here is an
                  example from Designmodo.com of how a modal might be implemented on a retail website:
                  <a href="https://designmodo.com/design-modal-windows/" style="display:block;text-align:center;padding:1rem 0">
                    <img style="width:85%" src="img/martz-post2-modals/modal-example.JPG" 
                         alt="image and link to an article showing examples of modal windows">
                  </a></p>
                <p>Recommended pre-knowledge for this lesson:
                  <ul>
                    <li>The basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS)</li>
                    <li>Familiarity with the DOM (Document Object Model)</li>
                  </ul>               
                  If you have this knowledge, let’s get to it!
                </P>
                
                <p>It is recommended that you open a code editor and try to create this modal step-by-step with me. 
                  Even better, try to add to the code or change it to make it your own.
                </p>

                <h6 style="font-size:1.1rem;font-weight:bold">Planning for the modal</h6>
                <p>As is always the case in web development, before you begin coding, you should think about the 
                  specific behavior you desire for your modal in terms of what is right for your audience (the user). 
                  Specifically, answer the following questions:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><p><span style="font-style:italic">What event will trigger the display of the modal?</span>
                      That is, when do you want the modal to appear? Will it be when the user clicks or hovers over an 
                      element on the page? Will it happen a few seconds after the page has loaded?</p></li>
                    <li><p><span style="font-style:italic">What event will trigger the disappearance of the modal?</span>
                      Will it be when the user clicks a close button on the modal? Or by clicking anywhere on the backdrop?</p></li>
                    <li><p><span style="font-style:italic">What transitions, if any, will the modal have as it enters onto the 
                      page?</span> That is, will it bounce a little? Will it slide onto the page? Something else?</p></li>
                  </ol>
                </p>

                <h6 style="font-size:1.1rem;font-weight:bold">The goal</h6>
                <p>In this article, I will show you how to create a very basic modal with no transitions as it comes onto the page.
                  You can always add the fancy features later. It will be activated by clicking on a specific image on the page. 
                  The act of the user clicking on the image is called an event in JS. As a bonus, I will also show you how to 
                  make a modal pop up after a slight delay when the page loads.</p>

                <h6 style="font-size:1.1rem;font-weight:bold">The code</h6>
                <p>The modal we’ll create will be the one that appears in the header image of this article. The code will make more sense if you understand
                first how the modal is constructed. You can think of it as having three layers. The bottom layer is the image of the
                mountains. When the page loads, this image without the modal is all you’ll see:</p>

                <p style="text-align:center">
                  <img style="width:85%" src="img/martz-post2-modals/kalen-emsley-Bkci_8qcdvQ-unsplash.jpg" alt="photo of mountain scenery">
                </p>
                <p>On top of that is the dark backdrop. The topmost layer is the text in the white box.</p>
                
                <p>The code will consist of one of each of these file types: HTML, CSS, and JS. Now we’ll get into what you came here for:
                  the code.
                </p>

                <h6 style="font-size:1.1rem;font-weight:bold">HTML</h6>
                <p>The HTML <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">&ltbody&gt</code> looks like this:</p>

                <p style="text-align:center">
                  <img style="width:85%" src="img/martz-post2-modals/modal-html.png" alt="">
                </p>

                <p>Notice that the very last element in the <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">&ltbody&gt</code> is the 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">&ltscript&gt</code> tag for the JS file. It's important to not put 
                  this in the <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">&lthead&gt</code>.</p>

                <p>Also, you'll see that there is an empty <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">&ltdiv&gt</code> with 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">class=”backdrop”</code> that will serve as our backdrop, 
                  which is the darkened overlay that will appear to be under the modal. There is also a 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">&ltdiv&gt</code> which will serve as our modal with 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">class=”modal”</code>, that contains some text. Within the 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">&ltmain&gt</code> tag, there is a 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">&ltdiv&gt</code> containing the image we will click on to activate, 
                  or “turn on” the modal.</p>

                <p style="background-color:#eeeeef;border:1px solid #000;padding:5px">Note: These class names are up to you to choose. 
                  They should be different from each other, and they should make sense to you.</p>

                <h6 style="font-size:1.1rem;font-weight:bold">CSS</h6>
                <p>The CSS shown below shows how the modal and backdrop should be styled. While most of these properties control
                positioning and appearance and are based in personal preference, there are three that are important for making the
                elements appear and disappear in the right way. I have highlighted those properties in yellow.</p>

                <p style="text-align:center">
                  <img style="width:50%" src="img/martz-post2-modals/modal-css.png" alt="">
                </p>
                
                <p><code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">display:none</code> on both the modal and the backdrop prevents 
                  them from showing up on the page when it loads. This property-value combination also takes these two elements out of the normal 
                  document flow, which means that no space for them is reserved on the page. (Contrast this with the way 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">visibility: hidden</code> works.). This is why the mountain image 
                  is showing at the top of the page, even though the backdrop and modal elements were built first in the HTML.</p>

                <p><code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">position: fixed</code> causes these elements to remain in 
                  the same place on the page even when the user scrolls. It is worth mentioning that this 
                  property also takes the elements out of the document flow. So, if for some reason, we chose not to use 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">display:none</code>, 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">position: fixed</code> would still be allowing the mountain 
                  image to appear at the top of the page.</p>

                <p><code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">z-index: 1</code> causes the modal to appear above other content 
                  on the page. Note that the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index">
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">z-index</code></a> can be any integer, and it must be set higher than the 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">z-index</code> of the element it will be appearing above. In this case, 
                  that other element is the photo of the mountain. The default value of <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">z-index</code>
                  for any element is <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">0</code>, and we did not change that for the mountain image. 
                  This means that a <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">z-index</code> of 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">1</code> or greater on the modal and backdrop will cause them to appear above the image.</p>
                
                <p>At this point, you may be wondering how the modal appears above the backdrop when they both have the same value for the 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">z-index</code>. Notice that in the HTML code the backdrop comes before the modal. 
                  When there is a “tie” in the <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">z-index</code> value, the order of elements in the HTML is the 
                  tie-breaker. The element that comes later will be on top of the one that comes before it in the HTML.</p>
                
                <h6 style="font-size:1.1rem;font-weight:bold">JavaScript</h6>
                
                <p>Finally, we have the JS. In the following JS code, we tell the browser three kinds of things:</p>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>what “nicknames” we’ll use for the elements we’ll refer to in the JS code (i.e., the variable declarations),</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>what to do when an event happens (i.e., the function declarations), and</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>what events to “listen” for and which function to run when the event happens (i.e., event listeners)</p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:center">
                  <img style="width:85%" src="img/martz-post2-modals/modal-js.png" alt="">
                </p>

                <h6 style="text-decoration:underline">Variable Declarations</h6>

                <p>The variables are declared at the top using <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">const</code>. 
                  Each variable name will serve as a shorter way to refer to the element in the rest of the JS, similar to the way 
                  we use a nickname for a person instead of their full name.</p>
                
                <p>The variable declarations here all use the <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">querySelector</code>
                  method to find the elements we want to target in the document, or the DOM.</p>
                
                <p>As you can see above, we are targeting the image, backdrop and modal by their classes assigned in the CSS.</p>

                <p style="background-color:#eeeeef;border:1px solid #000;padding:5px">Note: If there are multiple elements with 
                  a given class name, <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">querySelector</code> will only find the 
                  first one. If you need to find all of them for some reason, there are other methods that are better suited to the job.</p>

                <p style="background-color:#eeeeef;border:1px solid #000;padding:5px">Note: Be careful to use came case (e.g., camelCase) 
                  for the names of variables, functions, etc. in JS. If your CSS classes are specified in kebab case (e.g., kebab-case), 
                  however, keep them that way in the parentheses of the <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">querySelector</code>
                  method.</p>

                <h6 style="text-decoration:underline">Function Declarations</h6>
                
                <p>Remember how our CSS gave a <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">display</code> value of 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">none</code> to the 
                  backdrop and modal? Well, now we want to write a JS function that will change the 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">display</code> property to <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">block</code>
                   for them so that they will appear on the page. A function is like instructions for what to do and in what order to do it. 
                   Let’s call this function <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">openModal</code>. The two lines of code in this 
                   function simply assign the value of <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">block</code> to the style display property. 
                   They won’t do that assignment, though, until we call the function. More on that in a minute.</p>
                
                <p>We’ll also need a way to close (hide) the backdrop and modal after they are opened (displayed). To do that, we can write
                  a nearly identical function called <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">closeModal</code> that will assign the value of 
                  <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">none</code> to the style display property.</p>
                
                <h6 style="text-decoration:underline">Event Listeners</h6>

                <p>If we stopped here, the code would never change anything on the page. To make that happen, we need to tell JavaScript to “listen”
                  for a click on the image and then run the <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">openModal</code> function. Functions 
                  don’t do anything until they are called, so we call the <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">openModal</code> 
                  function in the event listener on the <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">imageMountain</code> element.</p>

                <p>Once the backdrop and modal are displayed, however, we can’t access anything on the page. In the case of our simple 
                  example, there isn’t anything on the page to interact with anyway, but most pages are not as simple as a single image. 
                  They are usually designed for some interactivity of the user with buttons, navigation bars, and other page elements. 
                  Now, remember the “layering” of our elements? If this were a typical page, all those clickable elements would be under 
                  the backdrop, which takes up the whole screen. As long as the backdrop is displayed, those elements are not clickable, 
                  and the user can’t interact with the page at all.</p>

                <p>Event listeners to the rescue again! Let’s add an event listener to the backdrop so that when JavaScript “hears” a click 
                  on it, the <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">closeModal</code> function will run. Actually, this event
                  listener is already included as the last line in the JS code above. Try removing it in your code editor and notice that 
                  the only way to make the backdrop disappear is to refresh the page. Always give your user an easy way to remove the backdrop 
                  and modal by clicking on it.</p>

                <h6 style="font-size:1.1rem;font-weight:bold">Bonus</h6>
                <p>So, of course, it is very cool and quite empowering for you, as a new coder, to be able to add a modal to your website. 
                  But, let’s be honest, in the real world, do you really want a modal to pop up <em>every</em> time the user clicks on the image? 
                  Probably not. And, if the user is a customer who wants to buy something from you, you definitely don’t want to get in 
                  the way of that shopping and payment process.</p>

                <p>What if there was a way to have the modal display just one time right after the page loads instead of when the user clicks? 
                  Well, there is! Instead of using an event listener that opens the modal, you could insert the following code at the bottom 
                  (or the top; it doesn’t matter) of the JS file and remove the line of code for the click event on the image 
                  (i.e., <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">imageMountain.addEventListener</code>…).</p>
                
                <p style="text-align:center">
                  <img style="width:50%" src="img/martz-post2-modals/modal-delay-js.png" alt="">
                </p>

                <p>Here we are saying, “Run the <code style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:1rem">openModal</code> function after the page 
                  has been open for 3000 milliseconds.” So, three full seconds after the page loads is when the modal will appear. The revised 
                  full JS file would look like this:</p>

                <p style="text-align:center">
                  <img style="width:85%" src="img/martz-post2-modals/modal-final-js.png" alt="">
                </p>
                
                <p>Note that the event listener that closes the modal with a click is still in there.</p>

                <h6 style="font-size:1.1rem;font-weight:bold">A final word</h6>
                <p>Modals have many uses, including error alerts, collecting information from users, and notification of a site’s privacy
                or cookies policy. You <em>may</em> not have known how to implement a modal before, but after reading this article, surely you
                <em>must</em> have a better idea now.</p>

                <p>If you enjoyed the corny plays on words here, you <em>can</em> thank me. If not, it’s my editor’s fault. In any case,
                congratulations on building your first modal! For more information on other events you could add to an event listener,
